# penlab
Attack and recon script for Education uses and Penetration testing labs

This  is a script to make your life easier when working in an  infoSEC lab. 
For Educational uses only.  I have tested this only on servers and devices that are authorized to do so. 
I will not be held accountable for any misuse of this tool up to and including any unlawful actions.
This is STRICTLY for educational purposes



# This script requires internal modifications for variables due to how it works and the programs It uses. Modify at your own risk!



I also would HIGHLY recommend to install/compile all of these programs within the penlab directory.    You dont have to, but if you dont, you will need to go through the script and change variables and run commands for programs that are not within the penlab directory
